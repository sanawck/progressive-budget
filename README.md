This app is designed to allow users track their budget. It works offline allowing flexiblity to users when tracking.

i could not figure out how to get the function to check the databse before deadline.

so this app does not full work but i have created the db and service worker as i saw fit.

this was successfully deployed to Heroku with no error.
